# BCI under distraction: Motor imagery in a pseudo realistic environment


## Introduction
We have recorded a motor imagery-based BCI study under 5 types of distractions that mimic out-of-lab environments and a control task. The aim of this study was to investigate the robustness of standard BCI procedures in a more realistic scenario. The distractions/secondary tasks include watching a flickering video, searching the room for a specific number, listening to news, closing the eyes, vibro-tactile stimulation and a control task. We recorded 16 healthy participants (6 female; age range: 22-30 years; mean age: 26.3 years) of which only three had previously participated in another BCI experiment.

## Experiment
The main experiment was divived into 7 runs. Each run lasted about 10 minutes and included 72 trials. Each trial lasted 4.5 s and was defined by one motor imagery task plus one of the 6 secondary tasks. The first run served as a calibration phase where no feedback was given and no distraction task added. The subsequent runs included the control task and the 5 distraction tasks and auditory online feedback. Feedback was based on Laplacian filters of the C3 and C4 electrodes and regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA).
